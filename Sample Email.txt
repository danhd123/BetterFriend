Title: ACTIVITY_NAME sometime soon?

Hi PERSON_NAME, 

I hope you're doing well. I've been enjoying the weather out here in San Francisco.

Just wanted to drop a line and see if you were free to catch up. Are you free to grab ACTIVITY_NAME at LOCATION_NAME next Wednesday (8/3)? Say 4PM? 

I look forward to talking to you soon.

Cheers,
USER_NAME
